Style Guide
---------

For this project I will be following the style convention used by android:
<http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html/>  
With exeception of the use of field names:
I will not be starting my variable names with an "s" or an "m" to indicate that the variable is respectively static or non-static and non-public.
Constant variables however will be fully caps with (possibly) underscores for readability.
